I referred to many websites I liked before starting design. Personal studio websites and brand websites were both included. Combined with the skills I have learned in class, I had a general idea. I wanted to put as many pictures as possible, but I found that inserting too many pictures will make it difficult to adjust the layout. So I did a lot of preparation work. 

I've always found it hard to manipulate grid layout. Inspect function did help a lot.

In the case of limited skills, I tried to show own style with colors and a large number of original pictures. And I paid attention to the details and adjusting the breakpoints better. 

Hope to creat better and more amazing web pages next term.
